# golf-playoff-momentum
Analyzing the relationship between momentum throughout golf tournaments & winning their respective playoff

This analysis is done on the basis of the 4 major golf tournaments since the year 2000:
  - Master's Tournament
  - PGA Championship
  - US Open
  - Open Championship

Momentum represents the golfer's score over the last x-number of holes

Within the analysis, the golfer's "xMScore vs Avg" and "xMScore Diff" will be seen, which both present data relative to an average.
This average refers to the average of the momentum scores of the golfers that competed in the respective playoff.

For further clarification: if the golfer competed against 1 other player in the playoff, then the average is based on his and his competitor's scores. If he competed against 2 or 3 others, then the average is based on his and the other 2 or 3 golfer's scores.
Average is NOT based on multiple playoffs. Only the respective playoff
